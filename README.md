RIPPLELAB is a multi-window GUI developed in MATLAB for the analysis of high frequency oscillations

This is the RIPPLELAB main folder. It contains folders and functions for
RIPPLELAB Multi Analysis EEG Project . 

A computing platform for processing continuous local field potentials
(LFP). The interface, additional to implement different documented 
algorithms for HFO detection, it provides several tools for signal 
visualization and manipulation, among which are found:
 - Channel(s) selection.
 - Display of multiple signal at the same time.
 - Several zoom and grid options (time, amplitude, etc.)
 - Possibility to make time and amplitude measurements directly on the 
 signals.
 - Adjustable filter options (notch, band-pass, etc.)

## Installation
Get the source code available at https://github.com/BSP-Uniandes/RIPPLELAB/

Add RIPPLELAB's files to the MATLAB path: [Home > Set Path > Add with subfolders]

or typing in the command window:
``` Matlab
addpath(genpath(c:/~your-ripplelab-basefolder));
```

## Usage
If RIPPLELAB files are in the MATLAB path, write the script name on the workspace
``` Matlab
p_RippleLab
```
