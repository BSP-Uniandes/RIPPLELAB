The aim of "Free toolboxes for Matlab" (FreeTb4Matlab) is to make functions from Octave and Octave-forge 
usable with Matlab. Automated tools (like Oct2mat and freetb4matlab) and manual modifications were applied. 


The automated conversion of OCT2MAT is very much improved. 
Several sanity checks are used to perform manual correction of the code.
