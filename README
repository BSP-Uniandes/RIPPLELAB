# RIPPLELAB
This is the RIPPLELAB main folder. It contains folders and functions for
RIPPLELAB Multi Analysis EEG Project . 

A computing platform for processing continuous local field potentials
(LFP). The interface, additional to implement different documented 
algorithms for HFO detection, it provides several tools for signal 
visualization and manipulation, among which are found:
 - Channel(s) selection.
 - Display of multiple signal at the same time.
 - Several zoom and grid options (time, amplitude, etc.)
 - Possibility to make time and amplitude measurements directly on the 
 signals.
 - Adjustable filter options (notch, band-pass, etc.)
